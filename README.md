## About

this is a simple terminal POS project, that reads in a set of goods from
the file system and allows the person running the program to add goods to
checkout.

It is primaraly inteanded to practice java as apposed to bieng a pragmatic
application, so keep that in mind while exploring.

it very inteantionally (and optionally for the assignment I might add) 
uses some functional programing ideas, multiple files
and classes in order to further famlierize myself with the language.
